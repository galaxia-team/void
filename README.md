# void
a simple programming language.

## inspiration
void is inspired by various languages:
- go
- python
- javascript

you will see elements from all of these languages within void.

## how it works
unlike normal interpreted languages, void does not use the usual `input -> tokens -> lexer -> parser -> output` format.

how it actually works is quite stupid. i am not an experienced programmer, and it clearly shows here.

## usage
```
go run void.go program.void
```
